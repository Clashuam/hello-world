First thing?

My name is Zachary Holland. I'm 18 years old. My house is in the Southeast section of Florida, where most the suburbs are, and I am not married. I work as an student for the University of Central Florida, and I get home every day by 12 AM at the latest. I don't smoke or drink. I'm in bed by 5 AM, and make sure I get two hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of cold water and doing about zero minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have a lot of problems sleeping until morning. Unlike a baby, I wake up with fatigue and stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose more sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I don't know what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
